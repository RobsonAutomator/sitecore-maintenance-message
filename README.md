# The idea
Every system needs maintenance. During maintenance work, the system is unavailable, or there may be temporary interruptions in its operation. It is good to inform system users about planned activities. It's best to do it in a place that is hard to overlook and always visible to system users. Content Editor and Experience Editor seems to be the best place for Sitecore.

# Solution
The Maintenance Message module has been implemented using [Sitecore Powershell Extensions](https://doc.sitecorepowershell.com/) (SPE). Because SPE integrates easily with the user interface in Sitecore.
